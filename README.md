# Moralis Streams API Beta ‚ö°Ô∏è

Stream blockchain data into your backend via webhooks. Ethereum, Polygon,
Avalanche, BNB Chain, Fantom, Cronos and all testnets are supported. More
networks are added soon.

- An address sends, receives, stakes, swaps or burns assets
- An asset is being sent, received, staked, swaped or burned
- A battle starts in your web3 game
- Someone participates in your token sale
- Any other smart contract event fires on-chain based on your filters
- Fully typed
- Contract Factories supported
- Filters supported

This README will intorduce you to Moralis Streams API.

### Useful links

- This guide will be using Moralis SDK to interact with Moralis Streams API. But
  you can interact directly with with Streams API using these
  [Swagger Docs](https://api.moralis-streams.com/api-docs/)
- [NestJS Demo](https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/streams-beta/tree/main/examples/nestjs)

## Pre-requisites

- [x] Create an account on [Moralis.io](https://moralis.io)
- [x] Get your API key [here](http://admin.moralis.io/web3apis)

# Roadmap üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

These are features that are not included in this beta but that will be out in
the near future:

- [ ] Including multiple assets or addresses in the same stream
- [ ] Mempool support
- [ ] Automatic retries (browsing failed deliveries and manually retrying is
      possible in beta)

# Your first stream üöÄ

In this example we will monitor a wallet.

Meaning all incoming and outgoing transactions of that wallet will be monitored!

### Programmatically

We will use Moralis SDK to create a stream.

You can install the Moralis SDK

```typescript
import Moralis from 'moralis';

Moralis.start({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
});

const stream = {
    address: '0x68b3f12d6e8d85a8d3dbbc15bba9dc5103b888a4' // address to monitor
    chains: [EvmChain.ETHEREUM, EvmChain.POLYGON] // list of blockchains to monitor
    description: 'monitor Bobs wallet', // your description
    network: 'evm',
    tag: 'bob', // give it a tag
    type: 'wallet' // can be wallet or contract,
    webhookUrl: 'https://YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL' // webhook url to receive events,
  }

const newStream = await Moralis.Streams.add(stream);
newStream.toJSON() // { id: 'YOUR_STREAM_ID', ...newStream }
```

### Via WebUI

1. Go to http://admin.moralis.io/streams/wallets/new
2. Click on `New Address Stream`.
3. Fill out the Form:
   - Address: `BOBS_WALLET`
   - Webhook URL: `https://YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL`
   - Tag: `bob`
   - Select Blockchain (e.g. Ethereum Mainnet)
4. Click on `Create Stream`

### Mandatory Test Webhook üö®

Whenever you create or update a stream you will receive a test webhook.

**You have to return status code 200 for the stream to be start.**

The test body will look like this:

```json
{
  "abis": [],
  "txs": [],
  "txsInternal": [],
  "logs": [],
  "chainId": "",
  "description": "This is a test webhook, to check if your webhook url is healthy.",
  "confirmed": true,
  "lag": 1,
  "retries": 0,
  "erc20Approvals": [],
  "erc20Transfers": [],
  "nftApprovals": [],
  "nftTransfers": []
}
```

## We are live! üéâ

Now whenever an ingoing or outgoing transaction involving the address you are
monitoring occurs, you will receive a webhook with the transaction details.

# Webhook Data

## Header

### Verify Webhooks

The Webhook will set a `x-signature` in the header. It is for verifying if the
data you will receive is from Moralis. Essentially it is a hash (sha3) of the
body and your API Key.

You can verify the webhook with the following code:

```typescript
import Moralis from "moralis";

const { headers, body } = request;

Moralis.Streams.verifySignature({
  body,
  signature: headers["x-signature"],
}); // throws error if not valid
```

## Body

The body contains the data you are interested in. Logs is in array containing
raw events and stream information such as tag and the streamId. The body also
contains a chainId, the blocknumber, internal transactions, the abis and a
confirmed field that indicates if the block is confirmed.

### Automatically Parsed Data üî•

Moralis automatically parses the following data for you:

- [x] ERC20 Transfers and Approvals
- [x] NFT Transfers and Approvals

Example Body:

```json
{
  "logs": [
    {
      ...rawLogs,
    }
  ],
  ...,
  "erc20Transfers": [
    {
      "from": "0x68b3f12d6e8d85a8d3dbbc15bba9dc5103b888a4",
      "to": "0x2faf487a4414fe77e2327f0bf4ae2a264a776ad2",
      "value": "9999678895548600000000000000",
      "transaction_hash": "0xb9730dd1b49061f3b5a6f93e0a66a03be199cad6f21ba5e8747a8087754e3e",
      "transaction_index": "40",
      "log_index": "48",
      "tag": "shib_transfers",
      "tokenAddress": "0x95ad61b0a150d79219dcf64e1e6cc01f0b64c4ce",
      "tokenName": "SHIBA INU",
      "tokenSymbol": "SHIB",
      "tokenDecimals": "18",
      "valueWithDecimals": "9999678895.5486"
    }
  ],
  "erc20Approvals": [],
  "nftTransfers": [],
  "nftApprovals": []
}
```

### Custom Parsed Data

If you are monitoring a custom custom contract you can parse the data yourself.
with the following code:

```typescript
// event MyEvent(address indexed from, address indexed to);
import { decodeLogs } from "@moralisweb3/evm-utils"; // YET TO IMPLEMENT IN SDK!!

interface MyEvent {
  from: string;
  to: string;
}

const webhook = { ...body, logs: [...logs] };

const decodedLogs = decodeLogs<MyEvent>(webhook);

decodedLogs[0]; // { from: '0x...', to: '0x...' }
```

# Streams

## GET Streams

You can see a list of all your streams by calling the following method:

```typescript
const streams = await Moralis.Streams.getAll({
    limit: 100 // limit the number of streams to return
    network: 'evm', // filter by network
});
```

Or you can see all streams in the [Admin Panel](http://admin.moralis.io/streams)

Checkout the type reference of a Stream
[here](https://api.moralis-streams.com/api-docs/)

## Monitor Stream

Sometimes you want to check if a stream is still active or if something went
wrong. When you query all your streams you can see the status of the stream.
There are three possible states: `active`, `paused` and `error`.

## Stream Settings

Moralis sets a default region for your stream. You can change the region
anytime. Choose the region that is closest to your backend for the best
performance.

### Set Settings

#### Programmatically

```typescript
import Moralis from "moralis";

Moralis.start({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

await Moralis.Streams.setSettings({
  region: "eu-central-1", // 'us-east-1' | 'us-west-2' | 'eu-central-1'
});
```

#### Manually

1. Go to [Settings](http://admin.moralis.io/settings)
2. Choose a region which is closest to your backend
3. Click on Save Changes

## Update Stream

In some cases you want to add a chain to an already existing stream or change
the webhook url. Luckily you can easily update your streams.

### Programmatically

Example on how to update the webhook url of a stream:

```typescript
import Moralis from "moralis";

Moralis.start({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

await Moralis.Streams.update({
  id: "STREAM_ID",
  webhook: "https://YOUR_NEW_WEBHOOK_URL",
});
```

### Manually

1. Go to [Streams](http://admin.moralis.io/streams)
2. Click the `Edit` Button on the stream you want to update
3. Change the things you want to update
4. Click on `Save Changes`

# Filter Streams

In some cases you might want to filter the data you receive from the webhook.
For example you are monitoring a nft collection but you only want to know if a
specific nft is transfered.

You can do this by adding a filter to the stream. Important: You must add a
(valid!) ABI of the event you want to filter! Otherwise the stream will not work

## Programmatically

```typescript
import { Moralis } from "moralis";
import { EvmChain } from '@moralisweb3/evm-utils'

const options = {
    address: '0x68b3f12d6e8d85a8d3dbbc15bba9dc5103b888a4' // address to monitor
    chains: [EvmChain.ETHEREUM] // list of blockchains to monitor
    description: 'monitor one NFT from Collection', // your description
    network: 'evm',
    tag: 'mySpecialNft', // give it a tag
    type: 'contract' // contract as NFT is a contract,
    abi: {}, // valid abi of the event
    filter: {"eq": ["tokenId", "1"]}, // only receive events where tokenId is 1
    webhookUrl: 'https://YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL' // webhook url to receive events,
  }

const stream = await Moralis.Streams.add(stream);
```

## Manually

1. Create a new Smart Contract Stream
2. Fill out the form
3. Add the Abi and choose from the topic dropdown
4. Add a filter
   - {"eq": ["tokenId", "1"]}
5. Save the stream

# Get Error

The Streams API provides an endpoint to get all failed webhooks. It is useful to
replay the failed webhooks.

## Programmatically

```typescript
const history = await Moralis.Streams.getHistory({ limit: 100 });
```

## Manually

You can use the Swagger UI or make an API call to the endpoint.

[Swagger](https://api.moralis-streams.com/api-docs/#/History/GetHistory)

```curl
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api.moralis-streams.com/history?limit=100' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

## Response

The Response is a list of failed webhooks that are uniquely identified by id.
The payload contains the webhook details.

```json
{
  "result": [
    {
      "id": "WEBHOOK_ID",
      "date": "string",
      "payload": {
        // the failed webhook
      },
      "errorMessage": "string",
      "webhookUrl": "string"
    }
  ],
  "cursor": "string"
}
```

# Replay Failed Webhook

You can replay (replay) a failed webhook by calling the specific endpoint.

## Programmatically

```typescript
await Moralis.Streams.retryWebhook({ id: "WEBHOOK_ID" });
```

## Manually

You can use the Swagger UI or make an API call to the endpoint.

```curl
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://api.moralis-streams.com/history/replay/WEBHOOK_ID' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
```
