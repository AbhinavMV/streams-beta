### Added

- Added `advancedOptions` option to create streams. With this option you can have more control over the topics you are passing to the stream. For each topic you can have advanced options that include the `topic`, a `filter` and a `includeNativeTxs` field

- Added `includeContractLogs` option to include or not all logs where the
  attached address is present in the logs [_address_, _topic1_, _topic2_,
  _topic3_]. Meaning if you are monitoring a wallet that interacts with a contract, you can decide to include the event logs besides the transaction details 

- Added `includeInternalTxs` option to include or not all internal transactions
  where the attached address is present in the from or to address of a the
  internal transaction

- Added `allAddresses` option to monitor **ALL ADDRESSESS** where the topic0 is
  emitted. Meaning if you are monitoring ['Transfer(address,address,uint256)'] and allAddresses is set to true you will get every transfer event from every contract that emits this event

- Added new endpoint `streams/evm/${id}/address`
    - POST: Add single or multiple addresses to the stream
    - GET: Get all addresses from the stream
    - DELETE: Delete a single or multiple addresses from the stream
